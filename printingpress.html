        <p>The printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century, transformed the way information was shared. By introducing movable type, Gutenberg made it possible to produce books efficiently, making knowledge accessible to a larger audience.</p>
        <p>This invention played a crucial role in the spread of literacy and education. It laid the foundation for newspapers, magazines, and modern publishing. Without the printing press, the world would not have experienced the rapid exchange of ideas that shaped history.</p>
